# A JavaScript Memory Game

### How to Play
Click on any card to flip it. Uncover two at a time, trying to reveal matching pairs. If you don't
find a match the cards return to their face down position. Once they match they stay flipped. Try
to get a high score by taking as few turns as possible to uncover all the cards. At any time you
can reset the game using the lower most button on the left.

#### About
One of my very first attempts at an app that combined DOM manipulation, CSS, and simple JavaScript.
Though the majority of the code was written while following the step by step instructions of an online
blog post, I am quite happy with the results, especially the information fields to the right of the
game. I coded them from scratch, at the very beginning of my coding life, and was quite happy to see that they produced proper results!

Recently added some responsiveness to the game so that the information fields remain visible should the screen get quite small.

I am also partnering with my [wife] on adding different art to the cards.

#### If There Was Time Unending
Knowing React it might be quite fun to completely refactor this game.
It would be nice to add some tests to the app.
Have a large store of art and randomize what 12 pieces get chosen per game.
