# A JavaScript Memory Game

### How to Play
Click on any card to flip it. Uncover two at a time, trying to reveal matching pairs. If you don't
find a match the cards return to their face down position. Once they match they stay flipped. Try
to get a high score by taking as few turns as possible to uncover all the cards. At any time you
can reset the game using the lower most button on the left.

#### About
One of my very first attempts at an app that combined DOM manipulation, CSS, and simple JavaScript.
Though the majority of the code was written while following the step by step instructions of an online
blog post, I am quite happy with the results, especially the infomration fields to the left of the
game. I coded them on my own, and was quite happy to see that they produced proper results!

#### If There Was Time Unending
Knowing React it might be quite fun to completely refactor this game. But more important to me would
be smoothing out the CSS. I would like to clean up the fonts and placement of the information fields,
and make app responsive. Finally, it would be nice to add some tests to the app.
